# 🧠 BrainBox

**Your personal, self-hosted knowledge vault — powered by Docker**

BrainBox is a lightweight web app to capture, organize, and search your notes, links, and ideas — all stored locally for privacy.
Runs entirely in Docker so you can deploy it anywhere with a single command.

## ✨ Features

* 🔒 **Private & Self-Hosted** — Your data stays with you
* 🌐 **Access Anywhere** — Runs locally or on a server
* 🐳 **Dockerized** — Simple setup with `docker-compose`

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (with persistent volumes)
* **Deployment:** Docker + Docker Compose

If you want, I can give you a **minimal MVP roadmap** so you can start coding BrainBox in a way that lets you finish the first working version fast — then improve it later for your portfolio. That way, you’ll have something to show in days, not months.
